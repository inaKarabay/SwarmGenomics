vcftools
	on VCF files
	Filter out specific variants
	Compare files
	Summarize variants
	Convert to different file types
	Validate and merge files
	Create intersections and subsets of variants
	variant calling: determining the differences between a sequenced donor genome and a given (linear) reference genome. In case of diploid or polyploid organisms, we additionally want to determine the corresponding ‘genotype’
		Variant calling entails identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions and deletion (indels) from next generation sequencing data.
	structural variations = variation in structure of an organism's chromosome.
		consists of many kinds of variation (region is 1 kb and larger in size )
