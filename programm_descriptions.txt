vcf-file;  format of a text file used in bioinformatics for storing gene sequence variations
BAM file:  binary format for storing sequence data. 
variant calling: determining the differences between a sequenced donor genome and a given (linear) reference genome. In case of diploid or polyploid organisms, we additionally want to determine the corresponding ‘genotype’
	Variant calling entails identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and small insertions and deletion (indels) from next generation sequencing data.
structural variations = variation in structure of an organism's chromosome.
	consists of many kinds of variation (region is 1 kb and larger in size )
